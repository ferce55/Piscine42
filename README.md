# C Piscine @ 42 Madrid

In this repository there are all the projects I made during the C Piscine.
  
## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
  # Shell
		In our first two projects, we learnt Basic comands to navigate through the terminal.

	# C Language
		The main skill we learnt during the Piscine is C. In our projects we used skills like
    pointers or memory allocation, we created basic functions and programs.

	# Git
		All our projects are submitted into a remote Git repository, so we had to learn to work
    with Git via Shell.

### Soft-skills
	# Teamwork
		The main Soft-skill we learnt during the Piscine, every weekend, we had a 48H group project,
    called "Rush" in groups of 3 or 4 random teammates, you will need to work together to
    complete it. The 2 biggest challenges during this project, are: first, distribute the diferent
    tasks equitably, and, second, that every teammate must understand everything in the code,
    so nobody can get "carried".
